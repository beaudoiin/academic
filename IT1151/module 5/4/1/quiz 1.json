    },
    "q11": {
      "question": "What is cross talk, and how do Twisted-'pair cables prevent this?",
      "fill in the blank":"Cross talk is when signals for adjacent pairs for wires generate noise. Because each pair of wires is twisted, the electromagnetic fields they produce cancel out over short distances. By twisting the two conductors together, the direction of the interference flips with every twist. So, the induced noise from one part of the twist is canceled by the next, since it’s equal in magnitude but opposite in polarity. ",
      "multiple choice": {
        "A1": "Crosstalk is when one cable’s signal reflects back into itself. Twisted-pair cables prevent it by twisting to match the impedance of the line.",
        "A2": "Crosstalk is static caused by moisture or poor grounding. Twisted-pair cables prevent it by using waterproof insulation to block noise.",
        "A3": "Crosstalk is when too many users share a network line. Twisted-pair cables stop it by using tighter insulation around each conductor.",
        "A4": "Crosstalk is when the electrical current weakens over distance. Twisted-pair cables prevent this by twisting to reduce resistance and maintain voltage.",
        "A5": "Crosstalk is when two devices transmit at the same time. Twisted-pair cables stop it by separating each signal onto different frequencies.",
        "A6": "Crosstalk is when signals from one pair interfere with another. Twisted-pair cables prevent it by reversing the wire positions so electromagnetic fields cancel each other out.",
